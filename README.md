# Java Training

Please, use this repository as a base for you training phase. The idea is to
fork this project so everyone uses the same folder structure for the
exercises.

It's extremelly important to keep the key points easy to be verified by
the reviewers, so **don't mix the key points with the rest of the
exercises**.

###Who Should Attend

The training will start with a basci review of Java and then goes beyond, including design and architecture modelling. The latter is not covered in depth. It requires a basic knowledge of the platform in question. Desirable participant profile: Java Junior Advanced Globant. A basic knowledge on OOP is desired.

###Technical Assistance

You can contact any professor if you need technical assistance. Contact them via email to luiggi.mendoza@globant.com and carlos.curotto@globant.com, or send an email. You're able to contact other participants as well. There will be a chat for participants and teachers only.

###Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice.

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with professor.

###Materials

1. Install [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Follow this [guideline](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to install it and check if works.

3. The IDE to use is [Eclipse for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). [JEE version Recommended](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/mars1).

4. Hangout Account (Globant) + headset (audio calls)

5. Create your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this [guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account. Also you can read further about Git in [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)

6. Fork this repo https://github.com/luiggi0925/java-training to use as a base to host the project code. Read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for instructions.

###General Guidelines

The training is organized in the following way:

1. There is a set of topics shown [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRs57MixPv9k7FbZRgx9OJSi_a4J4ZnZ1SV5_D-Hi_w/edit). Each topic is covered in slides, samples and exercises. Material for slides and exercises are shared in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B5GZwkHd0nWsc1FCM0RHMUpxUUE). Sample code for each topic can be found on this repo. Professors will explain the content in slides and show you the samples. Also, professors will be available to answer technical questions. If you cannot access to the slides, please ask to any professor to give you view permissions.

2. Exercises must be done in a branch of the project. Create a branch with your globant user but using a "-" instead of "." e.g. luiggi-mendoza. Professors will only review exercises done in each branch.

3. For exercises telling you to "describe", you have to create a file text and explain your experience about the subject being covered. If you have no experience, then just write "This is new to me." as the first sentence and add your expectations and how do you think it can be useful.

4. [Team play](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-qualities-of-an-effective-team-player.html) is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

5. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your tutor and teammates.

6. All code and documentation must be in English.

7. Code must adhere to this [eclipse code formatter](https://github.com/juanpablopizarro/java-bootcamp-2016/blob/master/formatter.xml). See importing instructions in this [link](http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-share-my-code-formatting-settings-with-another-user.html?page=2).
